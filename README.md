# Sphero-Control-Gui
A GUI written in Python and Tkinter to control Sphero robot toys with your keyboard or controller.

This is mostly AI-Generated code, but it works pretty well.

This is developed mainly for the Steam Deck, so the 16:10 aspect ratio fits the screen well.

## Modes

Normal Mode - Uses speed and heading APIs to provide a smooth and stable experience comparible to Sphero Edu App.

FPV Mode - Uses raw motor commands directly from your inputs - You're in control.

# Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running

```
